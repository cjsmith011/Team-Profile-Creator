# Team-Profile-Creator

Welcome to our Team Profile Creator.  In this app, you can quickly and 
easily build your team, including their name, email, role and job-specific
details.
I used Bulma.io for the styling to make it nice and clean.  The only challege there was figuring out the links since bulma.io definitely works differently in that aspect.

I did some work with Jest although I'm not at all comfortable with it or how best to employ it. 

To start the app, simply type 'node index' in your command prompt.  You 
can then answer a series of prompts with details about your team.  When you are finished, you can go to the 'index.html' in the 'dist'folder and Open it in your default browser to see your team.
